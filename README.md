# connect4-ai

Must have a working python 3 environment with tensorflow installed

On running connect4.py, it will first simulate 10 generations of 10 models each, for a total of 900 matches played.
It will then allow the user to play against the best AI model.

After generating an optimal AI model, connect4.py will also save it to saved_model.json, which can be read by quick_run.py in order to skip the generating phase.
An example as been provided.

To run either program, just launch them without command line arguments.
